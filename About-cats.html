            <h1>Domestic cats</h1>
            <p>
                The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.
                It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish 
                it from the wild members of the family.A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; 
                the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship 
                and their ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Domestic cats, no matter their breed, are all members of one species.
            </p>

            <h3>Relationship with Humans</h3>
            <p>
                Felis catus has had a very long relationship with humans. 
                Ancient Egyptians may have first domesticated cats as early as 4,000 years ago. 
                Plentiful rodents probably drew wild felines to human communities. 
                The cats' skill in killing them may have first earned the affectionate attention of humans. 
                Early Egyptians worshipped a cat goddess and even mummified their beloved pets for their journey to the next 
                worldâ€”accompanied by mummified mice! Cultures around the world later adopted cats as their own companions.
            </p>
                
            <h3>Hunting Abilities</h3>    
            <p>
                Like their wild relatives, domestic cats are natural hunters able to stalk prey and pounce with sharp claws and teeth. 
                They are particularly effective at night, when their light-reflecting eyes allow them to see better than much of their prey. 
                Cats also enjoy acute hearing. 
                All cats are nimble and agile, and their long tails aid their outstanding balance.
            </p>    
                
            <h3>Communication</h3>
            <p>
                Cats communicate by marking trees, fence posts, or furniture with their claws or their waste. 
                These scent posts are meant to inform others of a cat's home range. 
                House cats employ a vocal repertoire that extends from a purr to a screech.
            </p>
                
            <h3>Diet</h3>
            <p>
                Domestic cats remain largely carnivorous, and have evolved a simple gut appropriate for raw meat. 
                They also retain the rough tongue that can help them clean every last morsel from an animal bone (and groom themselves). 
                Their diets vary with the whims of humans, however, and can be supplemented by the cat's own hunting successes.
